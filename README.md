# Vale Counseling (2017)

- Client: Vale Counseling
- Agency: Boots
- Design: Boots
- Development: Boots

This is a static HTML version of a website I built for a Dallas counseling center, named The Vale. It was in use by the client until 2023, when they decided to move on to another website. It's one of my favorites, so I made this version for my portfolio.

This website is for my personal portfolio only.
